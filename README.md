## Gameplay
This game plays like any other version of breakout where the playerâ€™s aim is to break every single block on the screen. This is done by bouncing a ball around the screen and keeping the ball from escaping at the bottom of the screen by using a player-controlled paddle. User can control their paddle using their mouse. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, then the player will lose one life out of three total lives. When all lives all lost, the game is over. Your score, if higher than your previous attempts, will be added to the high scoreboard. The score is obtained by breaking the brick which will give you 10 points for a standard brick. If the player can break the bricks consecutively without losing a life, a multiplier will be applied to the bricks which will be indicated on the bricks. The maximum multiplier a player can earn is x3.
